## Principal (IT) langages:

### Python
![Python](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png)

This is the principal language, because with Python I can create a project very quickly. 

### C++
![C++](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg/306px-ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg.png)

I use this language because it's performance are good and I have to manage the pointers as C. 

### PHP
![PHP](https://www.php.net//images/logos/new-php-logo.svg)

This is the main language that I use to create web applications, such as database management. 

My main website is made, mainly, in PHP. 

### C
![C](https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-512/c-programming-569564.png)

I create programs in C, because it is the fastest and "lightest" high-language. 

### More

Language programs it's not a limitation, I can easily understand and use other languages.
